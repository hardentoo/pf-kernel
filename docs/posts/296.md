v4.12 release has brought lots of interesting things, and -pf made those
things even more interesting. So far:

  * VRQ is horribly broken. Investigation is ongoing, reliable reproducer is provided, go and check current results [here](https://cchalpha.blogspot.cz/2017/07/vrq-096d-release.html). Meanwhile, I've reverted VRQ from -pf tree, but still keeping an eye on it. Also, likely and hopefully, MuQSS might be available in a week or so. As of now, I've picked CFS tunables from zen-kernel to make mainline scheduler suck less. And indeed, it sucks less with those tunables.
  * **UPDATE:** MuQSS is broken too. Same reproducer is able to crash a kernel. Similar bugreport has been filed for Con [here](https://ck-hack.blogspot.cz/2017/07/electric-distraction.html?showComment=1501087358795#c102036580742833059).
  * blk-mq looks like broken too somehow. There are 2 discussions regarding suspend/resume issues. First is [here](https://marc.info/?l=linux-block&m=149987118814615&w=2), and it looks like it should be fixed by [this commit](http://git.kernel.dk/cgit/linux-block/commit/?h=for-linus&id=765e40b675a9566459ddcb8358ad16f3b8344bbe), which is already in -pf. Second is [here](https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=149844649610467&w=2), and I'd like to check what an outcome is. For me, both suspend and resume fail periodically, and I've disabled -mq to check if it helps. Maybe, I'll have to merge BFQ for SQ back.
  * `CONFIG_DM_MQ_DEFAULT=y` is not needed for non-multipath hardware. `CONFIG_SCSI_MQ_DEFAULT=y` is sufficient to have -mq enabled on commodity hardware.
  * If you do not play with CPU affinity and suspend/resume â€” everything works like a charm :).

Will keep you updated once have some news on this.
