For those, who use [latest](http://pf.natalenko.name/latest) and [latest-git](http://pf.natalenko.name/latest-git) files in scripts. Those files are deprecated â€” I'll remove them in month starting from this date. I suggest you using [site-latest](http://pf.natalenko.name/site-latest) file that has the following syntax: 
    
    
    x.y|z|dd.mm.yyyy|

where **x.y** is base kernel version, **z** is pf-kernel release, **dd.mm.yyyy** is release date. Here is the example for current version: 
    
    
    3.3|5|7.05.2012|

URLs' structure isn't going to be changed, but you should construct them by yourself. Please, correct your scripts ASAP.
