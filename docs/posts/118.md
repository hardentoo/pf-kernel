I've decided to start donation pool to gather some money for pf-kernel
development. I do not expect huge amount to be acquired, but:

  * in case of >$3000 I'll be able to buy separate powerful server and corresponding infrastructure to make build farm for pf-kernel to have binary builds prepared automatically just after release happens;
  * in case of $55 for one-time and $660 per year I'll be able to rent Hetzner dedicated server to make build farm for pf-kernel binaries as well;
  * in case of smaller amount I will pay for existing Hetzner VQ12 server and for domain as well.

I really appreciate that many of you use pf-kernel, and be sure your donations
won't be useless for it. You may donate any amount you want via Яндекс.Деньги,
WebMoney or Bitcoin on the [donation
page](http://pf.natalenko.name/donate.php). Thanks for your attention.
