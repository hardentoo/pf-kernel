  1. All board topic dumps are available to 3rd-party developers on email request with no restrictions. I really appreciate their efforts on kernel patching and always glad to collaborate with them.
  2. I do not maintain 3rd-party distro binaries and have no affiliation with them. I provided links to various repos with 3rd-party binaries in past, incl. ones for Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora, but they tended to be out of date most of time, so there is no reason to keep such links on main site. If there are active binary repos available, I will promote them here and/or via Twitter. Also, I provide universal Arch binaries optimized for several architectures as I use them personally.

I would be glad to hear Arch Linux pf-kernel AUR package and binaries
maintainers (nous? Thaodan? felixonmars?) as well as Gentoo people (Markos
Chandras? Alex Alexander?) to find out whether they are going to keep
supporting PKGBUILDs/ebuilds/binary builds for their favorite (and mine one â€”
Arch) distros. Please, guys, contact me via email, so I could provide up-to-
date links on main pf-kernel site. I really enjoy the fact that community of 2
big geek distros has adopted pf-kernel for general usage.
