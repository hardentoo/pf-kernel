Several things keeps new pf-kernel version from releasing:

  1. I've bought new laptop, so I have to make some config for it to test pf-kernel before release;
  2. there's some integer overflow bug in UKSM discovered for which I could make workaround, but now we (me and UKSM developer) are exploring it;
  3. some lack of time due to main work and living conditions.

Do. Not. Panic. Everything is fine. Just stay tuned.
