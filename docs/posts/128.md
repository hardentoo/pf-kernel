I've decided to replace community forum with ordinary simple blog-like news
feed. The reason is that community forum has no success in centralizing pf-
kernel development. Instead, I've got lots of pf-unrelated topics and posts
with zero value. Sorry guys, it is not the place to discuss other patches and
fill the board with thousands of useless «thx». All the links to release
announcements are preserved. So, if other site links my forum announcement,
redirect will do the correct job to display appropriate post. Comments as well
as other topics are not preserved, though. Also, news feed allows you to
subscribe to RSS as someone asked me for this. Voilà! Twitter feed will be
updated synchronously. Feel free to contact me via email. Thanks for using pf-
kernel, new releases are coming!
