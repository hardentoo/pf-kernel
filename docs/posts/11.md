I've pushed two new branches: [uksm-3.3](https://github.com/pfactum/pf-
kernel/tree/uksm-3.3) and [vserver-3.3](https://github.com/pfactum/pf-
kernel/tree/vserver-3.3). They won't be merged into pf-3.3, but if anyone
wants to test them — you are welcome. [VServer](http://linux-
vserver.org/Welcome_to_Linux-VServer.org):

    
    
    Linux-VServer provides virtualization for GNU/Linux systems. This is accomplished by kernel level isolation. It allows to run multiple virtual units at once. Those units are sufficiently isolated to guarantee the required security, but utilize available resources efficiently, as they run on the same kernel.

[UKSM](http://kerneldedup.org/en/projects/uksm/introduction/):

    
    
    UKSM is inspired by the Linux kernel project — KSM(Kernel Same page Merging), but with a fundamentally rewritten core algorithm. With an advanced algorithm, UKSM now can transparently scans all anonymously mapped user space applications with an significantly improved scan speed and CPU efficiency. Since KVM is friendly to KSM, KVM can also benefit from UKSM.
