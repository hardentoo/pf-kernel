I'm setting up the build farm — as I promised before I started the donation pool. The acquired amount of money is sufficient to maintain it during 9 months. But if you enjoy it, please, donate more — that is all about user consciousness, and this is all for you. The build farm is made of Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 16 GiB of RAM and of 2x3 TB HDDs. The cheapest one in Hetzner but powerful enough to cope with given tasks. As it isn't loaded up to 100% all the time, I think doing BOINC tasks between compilations would be OK. Anyway. I've prepared test builds for Debian, Ubuntu and Arch. No repos for now, only packages, because I'd like to have them tested before releasing as repos. So: 

  * Ubuntu: [i686, x86_64](http://pf.natalenko.name/binaries/ubuntu/3.7.1/);
  * Debian: [i686, x86_64](http://pf.natalenko.name/binaries/debian/3.7.1/);
  * Arch: [i686, x86_64](http://pf.natalenko.name/binaries/arch/3.7.1/).

There's little doubt that Ubuntu or Debian packages are weird as I used make-kpkg only. The highest interest of mine is dedicated to Arch binaries as I've written PKGBUILD from scratch. Please test it and give me some feedback. Thanks for your support of pf-kernel. Stay tuned.
