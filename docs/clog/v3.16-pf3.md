Hello, mates. I've just released new pf-kernel version for Linux 3.16 branch,
and it is 3.16-pf3.  
  
This is, basically, huge resync against stable tree and nothing more. Shortlog
is not so short, so I've decided not to put it here and point you to git log
instead.  
  
I really hope this is the last pf-kernel release for 3.16 kernel branch, and
the next one should be 3.17-pf1.  
  
Enjoy. And do not forget to grab the
[patch](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.16/patch-3.16-pf3.xz).
