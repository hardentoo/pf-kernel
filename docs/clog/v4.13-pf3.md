New pf-kernel release is already [here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.13/patch-4.13-pf3.xz): 

  * stable kernel release, v4.13.2, has been merged;
  * small improvement for BFQ is introduced, but possibly will be revised in next release;
  * minor bugfix for blk-mq is also there;
  * test patch against TCP warning is available.

Enjoy.
