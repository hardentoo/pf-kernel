Good evening to everyone. I'm proud to introduce first pf-kernel release for new 4.3 Linux kernel branch. Here goes [direct link](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.3/patch-4.3-pf1.xz) to fresh patch.  
  
Notable changes:  
  


  * I do not provide various configs and/or distro scripts anymore as they were useful exceptionally for myself; that is why this patch is somehow smaller.
  * I'm going to try openSUSE Build Service for building at least Arch Linux packages for Ivy Bridge and Kabini, because I'm interested in those builds.
  * This release contains downgraded BFQ to v7r8 because r9 contains some bugs that Paolo and Arianna are hunting for.
  * This release does not fix TuxOnIce+Btrfs issue yet.
  * This release contains BFS from Alfred's -gc branch + -ck mm Kconfig quirks.
  * UKSM has been (trivially) ported by me.
  * graysky's GCC patch has been updated to support Skylake.

  
Enjoy.
