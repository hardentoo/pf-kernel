OK, girls, we have to wait more for -ck to be released, but everything else is ready for now and have been tested by me for about a week, so I think it would be nice to share pf-kernel prerelease with you.  
  
But first of all please read small announcement. pf-kernel needs your support. You know I'm accepting donations, and since now it's possible to donate **bitcoins** to pf-kernel. So if you feel that this small patch deserves your thanks, please, send any amount you want to **1JRnTrfpXYrJDAExoyvqjzR9w3c9w4cSwU**.  
  
And let's continue. This prerelease comes without binary builds as I've got no idea why you need them in current state. This is just dev preview. It includes BFQ, UKSM, TuxOnIce and EnhanceIO as well. I hope -ck will come later, but for now I don't feel bad using vanilla CPU scheduler. Just try.  
  
You may grab the patch via [this link](http://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.10/patch-3.10.0-pf.bz2) right now and start compiling.  
  
Have a nice day.
