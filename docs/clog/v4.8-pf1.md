I'm glad to announce the immediate availability of pf-kernel release for shiny and new Linux v4.8 — v4.8-pf1. It incorporates usual set of extra patches, and among others are: 

  1. -ck patchset with BFS v0.512 + extra pending fixes. Please note that 4.8 is likely to be the last kernel with BFS scheduler. I believe I could replace it with BFS successor — MuQSS — soon. More details on it [here](https://ck-hack.blogspot.cz/2016/10/muqss-multiple-queue-skiplist-scheduler.html).
  2. BFQ v8r3 for 4.8 pre-release. Actually, -pf1 just includes latest code from BFQ's git branch.
  3. Latest buffered writeback throttling code for 4.8 kernel.
  4. As usual, graysky's GCC patch for you CPU.
  5. Random fixes here and there.

[Enjoy](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.8/patch-4.8-pf1.xz).
