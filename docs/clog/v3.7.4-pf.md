Another step in pf-kernel development — v3.7.4-pf is out, please, grab [the patch](http://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.7/patch-3.7.4-pf.bz2) right now and try it ASAP.  
  
The main update is considered to be TuxOnIce update — there is some small fix appeared addressing memory allocation issue. I've tried it on my laptop, and indeed TOI works now (previously, it didn't work or worked awfully) but not for big memory images. If I fill RAM with 1.5 GiB of apps, it fails to hibernate. Sad but true. Will wait for other fixes from Nigel.  
  
Another huge improvement is EQM patch merged for BFQ. I'm not going to retell you what EQM is here, just go and read [official announcement](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/bfq-iosched/H7PCRpreLAQ/discussion). Also there is another small BFQ fix dedicated to rare kernel crashing.  
  
As usual, stable patches are merged as well — 3.7.5 for now (despite of having 3.7.6-rc1 staging). Everything works OK for me.  
  
Binary builds for Arch, Debian and Ubuntu are ready too. Grab them from [here](http://pf.natalenko.name/binaries/).  
  
Shortlog is appended as well.
