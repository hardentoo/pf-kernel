Hola. New pf-kernel release is
[here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.12/patch-4.12-pf4.xz). It brings
you CPU affinity fix for VRQ ( _many thanks to Alfred for quick response_ ) as
well as latest stable update, v4.12.4. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out
yet what causes hangs on suspend/resume with blk-mq enabled. Still trying to
reproduce it in a VM to get some logs and/or dumps. Otherwise, things look
okay. Stay tuned and enjoy.
