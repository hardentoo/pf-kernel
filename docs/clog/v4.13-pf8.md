Hello. Fresh pf-kernel release is already available [here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.13/patch-4.13-pf8.xz), and news are as follows: 

  * latest stable kernel upgrade, v4.13.6, has been merged;
  * PDS CPU scheduler has been updated to v0.98b fixing some pitfalls with Wine and incorrectly calculated deadline;
  * small but important BFQ fix has been applied;
  * Ming's blk-mq performance patchset was updated to latest version, trimming outdated 2nd part of it for the time being.

Also, I've started thinking about relocating patches to GitHub releases and merging news with main site. Stay tuned for further updates. Enjoy.
