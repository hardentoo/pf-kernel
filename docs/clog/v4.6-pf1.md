Hello there. I'm here to make an announcement of immediate [v4.6-pf1](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.6/patch-4.6-pf1.xz) availability. This release includes v4.6.2 stable kernel, BFSv0.470 ( _issues with -vrq are still under investigation_ ), BFQv7r11 ( _for now it is recommended to turn hierarchical scheduling off_ ) writeback and network-related bufferbloat fixes, GCC tunes patch and small fixes for my hardware. This release does not incorporate TuxOnIce and UKSM anymore. However, Łukasz Żarnowiecki told me he was going to support UKSM, so as of now the patch is available separately [here](https://github.com/dolohow/uksm/blob/master/uksm-4.6.patch). Please test and contact him in case you have any questions. v4.6-pf1 binary builds are available for Arch Linux for 64-bit Ivy Bridge and Jaguar platforms. Enjoy.
