Hello, everyone.  
  
After some hesitation I've decided to release first pf-kernel patchset for 4.2 Linux kernel branch.  
  
It consists of usual parts:  
  


  * latest stable update ( _4.2.1 as of now_ );
  * BFS CPU scheduler ( _Alfred 's -gc branch, v463 with improvements_) and -ck mm stuff;
  * BFQ I/O scheduler, v7r9;
  * latest TuxOnIce from git tree;
  * UKSM;
  * GCC -march improvements from graysky;
  * various configs and distro scripts.

  
The new part is "tunables" folder that holds my own hibernation-related systemd scripts, sysctl tunables and linux-sensors config for one of my motherboards. Just in case.  
  
I encourage you to grab the patch [here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.2/patch-4.2-pf1.xz). Please note, that I've regenerated my GPG key, so public one is available [here](https://natalenko.name/?page_id=2675).  
  
Known issues:  
  


  * some people report BFQ-related crashes on their machines, although I haven't observed such a behavior on my 3 machines;
  * TuxOnIce refuses to work with my disk layout, that includes RAID10, LUKS, LVM and btrfs ( _mainly because of btrfs, I guess_ ), and [this bug is already reported](http://lists.tuxonice.net/pipermail/tuxonice-devel/2015-September/007542.html) to Nigel.

  
Nevertheless, I hope you'll enjoy this.
