OK, guys, I thought we might wait for 3.5.1-pf for quite long time, so I've decided to release one more pf-kernel update that includes Linux 3.4.6 stable update.  
  
[Here is the patch](http://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.4/patch-3.4.6-pf.bz2).  
  
This update doesn't contain "Rewrite and fix load-avg computation" commit as it breaks BFS. Con suggested me just to revert that crap, so I followed such a wise advice. Don't understand how such things could be broken in stable tree… Indeed.  
  
Another fix (or better to say "weak attempt to fix") is porting layer7-related commit from dd-wrt tree. I have no expectations about it but if it works… you'll tell me, OK?  
  
And here's shortlog as usual:
