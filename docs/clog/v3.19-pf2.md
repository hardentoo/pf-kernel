It's spring here! I'm glad to introduce bug-fixing and intermediate release of
pf-kernel for 3.19 kernel branch â€” 3.19-pf2. The patch is located
[here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.19/patch-3.19-pf2.xz).  
  
There are two important changes. First of all, I've fixed TOI for 32-bit
kernels (at least compiling, please test it by yourself on the real hardware,
mine is 64-bit). Secondly, GCC optimizations patch has been bumped to support
GCC v4.9+, and that means you cannot turn on modern Intel optimizations using
older GCC. Also there is some preempt_schedule_common() introduction, but I
hope nobody should notice that.  
  
Many thanks to Alfred Chen and kernelOfTruth for their efforts of BFS
maintaining.  
  
Please note this release does not incorporate official -ck1 released by Con as
I want to merge it with additional patches made by abovementioned guys. Those
should be here on -pf3 release.
