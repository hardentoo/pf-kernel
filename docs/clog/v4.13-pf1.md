This release is a very quick one. As usual: 

  * BFS VRQ CPU scheduler by Alfred Chen, because MuQSS is not ready yet;
  * UKSM, ported from 4.12 branch without visible issues;
  * graysky's GCC CPU tunables;
  * a bunch of not-yet-released BFQ fixed;
  * even more blk-mq fixes and improvements: 
    * patchset aiming to improve blk-mq performance greatly;
    * patchset aiming to fix suspend/resume issues properly;
  * random fixes here and there.

Should work okay. Grab the patch [here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.13/patch-4.13-pf1.xz) and enjoy.
