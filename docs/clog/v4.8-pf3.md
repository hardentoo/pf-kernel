[New pf-kernel release](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.8/patch-4.8-pf3.xz) brings 3 important updates: 

  1. stable v4.8.4 has been merged;
  2. MuQSS has been updated to latest git code;
  3. BFQ has been updated, but this is considered to be minor update.

Arch Linux binary builds for Intel Ivy Bridge and Silvermont are available as well. Please enjoy. P.S. Please consider this announcement to be the real release. If you were happy to download patchset before this announcement, you have to redownload it now because I did several respins due to last-minute MuQSS fixes.
