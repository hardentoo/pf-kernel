Hello, pf-kernel folks. First autumn pf-kernel release, v4.7-pf3, is out. Please grab the [patch](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.7/patch-4.7-pf3.xz) immediately. This release features stable Linux 4.7.3 update as well as new and shiny BFS v0.490 along with dummy CGROUP_SCHED support ( _docker users might be happy_ ) and extra fixes. BFQ version has been updated as well, but no code has been changed â€” v8r3 only reflects current state properly. Enjoy.
