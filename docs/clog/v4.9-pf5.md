New pf-kernel release features latest Linux stable update, v4.9.8. Also, I've merged BFQ v8r8-rc1 just because it contains potentially important fixes. The patch is available [here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.9/patch-4.9-pf5.xz). Special announcement about Arch Linux binary builds: I'm going to drop separate Intel Ivy Bridge build, however, this architecture will be still available for linux-pf-next package. Instead, I'm going to keep Silvermont and also present generic ( _w/o specific CPU optimizations_ ) as well as Skylake architectures. Stay tuned for further announcement.
