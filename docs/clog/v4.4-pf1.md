I'm glad to announce the immediate availability of first pf-kernel release for
4.4 Linux branch â€”
[v4.4-pf1](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.4/patch-4.4-pf1.xz). I hope
some of you have already enjoyed -pf0 prerelease, and -pf1 is almost the same.
As usual, pf-kernel incorporates:

  * BFS v0.466, -vrq branch by Alfred Chen;
  * new and shiny BFQ v7r10;
  * TuxOnIce;
  * UKSM merged from 4.3 branch with no changes at all;
  * graysky's GCC optimizations patch;
  * small set of fixes by me (yet unmerged YeAH fix as well as some TCP warnings removal).

Official binary builds are available for 64-bit Arch Linux ([Intel Ivy
Bridge](http://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:post-factum/linux-pf-
ivybridge) and [AMD Jaguar](http://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:post-
factum/linux-pf-jaguar) only). Feel free to make your own builds. Enjoy.
