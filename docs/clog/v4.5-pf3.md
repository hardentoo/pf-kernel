Hey, [here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.5/patch-4.5-pf3.xz) is new pf-kernel release available. This one brings you stable Linux kernel v4.5.3 and updated background writeback throttling patchset. Also, I've adopted the latter for BFQ, and hope it works well for you. Lastly, there are fq_codel bufferbloat-related enhancements merged as well, partly backported from 4.6, partly taken from net-next branch. I hope you'll enjoy it.
