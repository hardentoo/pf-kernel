Hello again. There is no time for dancing around, so here is new pf-kernel
release available. With this fast release I expect (at least) 3.19-related
work to progress with normal tempo. Please grab the patch
[here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.19/patch-3.19-pf1.xz).  
  
This release introduces usual set of changes:  
  

  * BFQ v7r7;
  * BFS v460 ported by Alfred Chen;
  * UKSM v0.1.2.3 ported by me (trivial merge in fact);
  * latest available TuxOnIce patch for 3.19 kernel with small fix from me;
  * extra GCC tuning options by Graysky;
  * my configs and PKGBUILD.

  
I hope official BFS is on the horizon as well as TuxOnIce updates.  
  
Stay tuned.
