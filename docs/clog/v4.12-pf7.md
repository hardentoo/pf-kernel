New pf-kernel release is available
[here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.12/patch-4.12-pf7.xz). Finally,
MuQSS CPU scheduler is fixed and merged, replacing VRQ. Works okay as usual,
and I think I should do some benchmarking a-la MuQSS vs VRQ, because
perceptional difference is minimal. This time I've decided not to merge the
whole -ck patchset because it seems I had issues with timers changes presented
by it leading to sound to crackle sometimes. MuQSS alone does not expose such
a behavior. Thus, I do not see much reason to apply the whole -ck it in
future, so lets assume I've decided to stick to scheduling part only. Latest
stable update, v4.12.8, is merged as well. Enjoy.
