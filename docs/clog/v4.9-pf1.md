I'm glad to announce the immediate availability of new pf-kernel release for
fresh Linux kernel. Please grab the patch
[here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.9/patch-4.9-pf1.xz). As usual:

  * -ck with MuQSS v0.150 + very latest hotfix;
  * BFQv8r5, forward-ported from LKML submission + writeback throttling enhancement, hoping to get v8r6 soon;
  * buffered writeback throttling patchset, hoping it will find its way into mainline soon;
  * GCC tunes patchset from graysky, aiming to tune kernel for your lovely CPU;
  * small random fixes.

Enjoy, and thanks to Con for fast -ck development.
