Greetings. I was almost ready to release v4.9-pf6 update with newer stable
patches, but instead got managed to assemble v4.10-pf1 very quickly thanks to
awesome Con's passion as well as BFQ readiness. So, [here is
v4.10-pf1](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.10/patch-4.10-pf1.xz), and it
includes:

  * latest -ck release featuring MuQSS CPU scheduler v0.152;
  * latest BFQ I/O scheduler, v8r8-rc2, with mainlined writeback throttling integration by me;
  * graysky's GCC optimizations patch.

Hopefully, in a couple of upstream releases I won't provide BFQ separately,
and it will be mainlined. Fingers crossed. Enjoy.
