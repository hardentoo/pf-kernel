Hey, guys. I have got good news for you.  
  
I've just released pf-kernel v3.5.1-pf, and after you start applying [this
patch](http://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.5/patch-3.5.1-pf.bz2) and compiling
new kernel, I'll tell you about it a little bit.  
  
New pf-kernel release except well-known BFQ and TuxOnIce introduces two
incredible things:  
  

  * UKSM — online kernel memory data deduplication, which merges same memory pages, saving lots of RAM ( _/me using Firefox saved ~300 MB_ );
  * BLD — an alternate CPU load distribution technique for Linux kernel scheduler. Once againg: this is not a new scheduler, but new load balancer for CFS ( _merged, because there 's no BFS for 3.5 for now_).

  
Also new pf-kernel release removes these two things:  
  

  * LinuxIMQ — no new patches are available, I do not use it, so apply patches by yourself or use IFB ( _not the same, but it may do some tricks_ );
  * l7-filter — cannot get it work, and no patches from developers, so… there's no alternative, though, so just don't use it.

  
I'd to highlight that pf-kernel is for desktop users, so I won't merge server
stuff.  
  
Known issue: TOI still doesn't work for me. I use in-kernel hibernation.  
  
Thanks to BLD developer, Rakib Mullick, for fixing BLD loadavg issue ASAP. I
really want to get feedback from you about BLD, so feel free to post your
thought to [this board](http://pf.natalenko.name/forum/index.php?board=18.0).
