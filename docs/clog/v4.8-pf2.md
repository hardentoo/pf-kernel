I'm glad to announce [immediate
availability](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.8/patch-4.8-pf2.xz) of
v4.8-pf2. This release brings you the following changes:

  * BFS CPU scheduler has been replaced by its successor, MuQSS. Please, see details [here](https://ck-hack.blogspot.de/2016/10/muqss-multiple-queue-skiplist-scheduler.html).
  * BFQ I/O scheduler has been updated to v8r4.
  * Buffered writeback throttling patches have been updated as well to latest git code.
  * Stable Linux v4.8.2 has been merged.
  * Misc MuQSS build-related fixes have been cherry-picked from Zen Kernel.
  * Intel Silvermont builds for Arch Linux have been [introduced](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:post-factum/linux-pf-silvermont).

Please go and test. We do not change CPU scheduler every day.
