New pf-kernel release — v4.1-pf1 — is out and available
[here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.1/patch-4.1-pf1.xz).  
  
It is based on fresh stable 4.1.2 kernel and incorporates usual set of
patches. Among others are:  
  

  * BFS CPU scheduler ported by Alfred Chen;
  * BFQ I/O scheduler, official release;
  * TuxOnIce for some 4.1 prerelease, fixed by me;
  * UKSM, ported by me;
  * graysky's GCC optimization patch;
  * some small verbosity fixes by me;
  * several configs as well as local PKGBUILD for Arch Linux.

  
Thanks to everyone who tried 4.1-pf0.
