Hello. Another pf-kernel release is here: 

  * VRQ has been updated to v0.97b;
  * BFQ is now WBT-aware in the same way I did for BFQ-SQ before â€” WBT is disabled for queues managed by BFQ since BFQ maintains its own throttling;
  * latest stable kernel release, v4.13.1, is merged.

Grab [the patch](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.13/patch-4.13-pf2.xz) and enjoy.
