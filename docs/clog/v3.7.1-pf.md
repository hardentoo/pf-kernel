OK, guys, it's time to make the last major release of pf-kernel before December, 21st. Don't know whether Mayan people used to compile kernels themselves but we definitely do compile them ( _kernels not people_ ). Grab [the patch](http://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.7/patch-3.7.1-pf.bz2) and let your gcc do the rest.  
  
In fact, we've got -ck with BFS from Con Kolivas, BFQ from Arianna and Paolo, UKSM from Nai Xia and TuxOnIce from Nigel merged as usual. Small piece of diff from me — I've fixed kernel to allow alx ethernet driver be built with NET_VENDOR_ATHEROS=y. Hope this will be fixed in compat-drivers.  
  
The main risk comes with UKSM as I've merged prereleased patch ( _not the official one!_ ). There's known problem with NULL pointer somewhere in KSM ( _sic! mainline_ ), so be careful. If it happens to you, just disable UKSM ( _but I 've tested it on my laptop — works OK_).  
  
The last thing for today: you are welcome with [donations](http://pf.natalenko.name/donate.php). Over $590 are acquired at the moment, and I think I'll start playing with build farm after New Year happens.  
  
Have a nice day.
