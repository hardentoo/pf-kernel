Hello. Another pf-kernel update is
[here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.12/patch-4.12-pf3.xz). It brings
you compilation fix for UP systems, hopefully fixed suspend/resume with blk-mq
enabled and a couple of experimental BFQ fixes. Also I've discovered some VRQ
issue leading to lockup. It is triggered by the_silver_searcher aka ag tool.
Still have no idea what's happening there, but VRQ author is notified, and the
issue is under investigation. Anyway, everyone must upgrade. Enjoy.
