I'm here to make an announcement of fresh pf-kernel release for 4.5 kernel branch â€” [v4.5-pf2](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.5/patch-4.5-pf2.xz). This new version introduces stable Linux release v4.5.2. Also, I've merged latest writeback throttling code ( _the one that should become v6 soon_ ). BFQ has been updated to official version ( _with almost no changes in code_ ). Those are mainly all the changes in this release. Also, I've decided to abandon UKSM and TuxOnIce for future 4.6 branch. Unfortunately, I see no reason to use UKSM for me anymore. Also, I see no progress on its development, and, sadly, I couldn't get in touch with its developer. If there is the one that could take over the maintenance, I'd happily make git diff for him. Regarding TuxOnIce, it stopped working for me several kernel releases ago, and while I have all the necessary bugreports filled, it is still not fixed, so I couldn't even test it properly. Fortunately, you will be able to apply Nigel's patches directly from his site or git tree if he continues the development. Please, note, that UKSM and TuxOnIce are already disabled in my binary builds for Arch Linux ( _Ivy Bridge as well as Jaguar_ ). No shortlog here. Noone reads that :).
