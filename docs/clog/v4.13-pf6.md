Quick pf-kernel refreshment is already [here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.13/patch-4.13-pf6.xz), and it brings you the following: 

  * PDS CPU scheduler has been updated to v0.98a;
  * both patchsets from Ming Lei regarding fixing suspend/resume issue with blk-mq enabled as well as improving blk-mq performance have been updated to latest versions.

Overall, nothing major, but upgrade is always recommended. Enjoy.
