Hi there. First pf-kernel release for fresh Linux kernel v4.11 [is out](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.11/patch-4.11-pf1.xz). Things are as usual, except MuQSS being replaced with BFS VRQ branch because Con haven't prepared a port yet. Nevertheless, it works okay for me, so enjoy. Binary builds for Arch Linux are being built. Expect them to be ready in 24 hours. Likely, this is the last "traditional" pf-kernel release as BFQ I/O scheduler has been merged into upstream and will be available for blk-mq with 4.12 release. Maybe, I should consider adding some things like UKSM back just to stay cool :).
