I'm glad to announce the availability of next pf-kernel release â€” v4.8-pf5. It
brings you latest stable kernel, v4.8.5, latest MuQSS CPU scheduler, v0.120,
with high-res timers and proper NO_HZ support, and updated BFQ to v8r5. Please
go [grab it](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.8/patch-4.8-pf5.xz) and
enjoy. This should be the most exciting release of this year.
