Hi, girls!  
  
In spite of having not so much free time, I've found one to prepare next pf-
kernel release. So be so kind to grab the
[patch](http://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.5/patch-3.5.3-pf.bz2) and start
compiling it right now.  
  
Mainly, this release incorporates 3.5.3 stable kernel.  
  
There well-known bug in UKSM with scan_time integer overflow (or so) for which
I've included debug workaround: now instead of falling into BUG_ON dark screen
in just reports useful info into dmesg. So if you encounter it, PLEASE SHOW ME
YOUR DMESG IMMEDIATELY.  
  
I've added early config for Dell Vostro 3360 laptop and deprecated Dell
Inspiron 1525 laptop config. In fact, adopting kernel for new laptop took 99%
of preparation time.  
  
PKGBUILD for Arch Linux was improved. I use it for local compilation,
probably, you'd better use AUR's one.  
  
Other issues: not-fixed bug with SD cards (sorry, no reason to just zero-
returning specific functions) and lots of ACPI warnings (they are almost fixed
in LKML, but I haven't grabbed the patch yet).  
  
You are welcome with your suggestions.  
  
Enjoy shortlog below:
