Hello, mates. After testing a while new patch saltwork I'm happy to introduce [first pf-kernel release](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.16/patch-3.16-pf1.xz) for 3.16 Linux kernel branch.  
  
This patch (as usual) incorporates BFS scheduler from Con Kolivas (new version 450), BFQ I/O scheduler from Italian guys and girls (v7r5 for now), TuxOnIce from Australia and Chinese UKSM (in fact, my port from 3.15 to 3.16) :). This release also includes stable patch bomb (v3.16.1, I've decided not to wait for .2 because of kernel summit) and graysky's GCC optimization patch (for GCC 4.2+).  
  
Small and useless shortlog is here. Please, pay your attention that Alfred's BFS-related patches have been replaced with official -ck, but git history keeps them all.
