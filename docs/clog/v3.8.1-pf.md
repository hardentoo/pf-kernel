Despite of having early spring -rc here, in Kyiv, Ukraine (+10°C yesterday and
raining versus -5°C and streets full of snow today — St. Patrick, please, fix
it ASAP), I've released new pf-kernel version — v3.8.1-pf (at last). Anyway,
you know what to do with [the
patch](http://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.8/patch-3.8.1-pf.bz2).  
  
Everything is as usual: -ck with BFS, BFQ, TuxOnIce and UKSM, but there's
another new patch — EnhanceIO. It allows you to cache your HDD data on SSD,
greatly improving system performance. Please, read more
[here](http://www.stec-inc.com/product/ssdcache.php) (in English) and
[here](http://habrahabr.ru/post/169845/) (in Russian).  
  
Another improvement is merging lzo enhancements from 3.9 tree — it improves
vanilla hibernation performance greatly.  
  
There's known [issue](https://github.com/stec-inc/EnhanceIO/issues/27) — pf-
kernel doesn't compile when EnhanceIO in chosen to be built-in. Anyway, it
works OK for me as module, so give it some try if you've got SSD in your
computer.  
  
Binary builds are ready as well, feel free to grab them from
[here](http://pf.natalenko.name/binaries/).  
  
Let the spring begin.
