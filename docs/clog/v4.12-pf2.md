I'm glad to announce next 4.12 branch update, featuring [v4.12-pf2](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.12/patch-4.12-pf2.xz). This release introduces new BFS VRQ version, v0.96d. Also, I've merged three fixes for BFQ. Finally, tp->retrans_out WARN_ON muting is back again. Of course, latest stable update, v4.12.2, is also here. Please note I'm still trying to investigate issues with suspend to RAM. Currently, I cannot blame BFQ and UKSM as issue happens when those are disabled. It is either blk-mq framework or BFS, but I need more time to investigate it. Note that blk-mq framework will be disabled in Arch by default due to problems with suspending, so it might be a hit. Leaving here udev rule for enabling BFQ by default, instead of systemd unit posted before. `$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/10-bfq.rules ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]*", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="bfq"` Enjoy.
