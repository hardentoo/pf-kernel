Happy spring! Here is new pf-kernel release for you â€” 4.0-pf1.  
  
This major release incorporates usual set of patches. Among others are:  
  


  * BFS CPU scheduler (not the official one although Con has already released v462; I'll merge it into -pf2 soon);
  * BFQ I/O scheduler (unofficial, merged from 3.19 branch);
  * UKSM (my port from 3.19 branch);
  * TuxOnIce (official 4.0 branch merged);
  * graysky's GCC patch;
  * other small fixes, configs etc.

  
The patch itself is available [here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.0/patch-4.0-pf1.xz). Happy testing.
