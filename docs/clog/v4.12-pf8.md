Another pf-kernel release is [here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.12/patch-4.12-pf8.xz). It brings you latest stable update, v4.12.10, as well as recent BFQ fixes along with ( _hopefully, finally_ ) fixed blk-mq suspend/resume issue. If everything goes fine, next release should be withing 4.13 branch. Enjoy.
