Hello, folks. This should be [another awesome
release](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.12/patch-4.12-pf1.xz) because:

  * BFQ is mainlined;
  * UKSM is back.

Since BFQ is in upstream already and works only with MQ, in order to use it
you must enable MQ. You may do that via kernel command line by adding
`scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=1` option or by altering kernel config file and
recompiling it with the following changes: `CONFIG_SCSI_MQ_DEFAULT=y
CONFIG_DM_MQ_DEFAULT=y` Otherwise, you won't be able to select any MQ-aware
I/O scheduler ( _deadline, Kyber, BFQ_ ). Also, note that you cannot set
default MQ scheduler, so do something like this: `$ cat
/etc/systemd/system/bfq@.service` `[Unit] Description=Set BFQ for %i [Service]
Type=oneshot ExecStart=-/usr/bin/bash -c 'echo bfq
>/sys/block/%i/queue/scheduler' RemainAfterExit=yes [Install] WantedBy=multi-
user.target` And: `systemctl daemon-reload systemctl enable bfq@sda systemctl
start bfq@sda` replacing `sda` by what you have there in your PC.
Alternatively, you may brew your own udev rule. This release also provides BFS
with VRQ from Alfred Chen. Once MuQSS is out, I'll merge full -ck patchset
instead. The only issue I've faced so far is that my laptop is unable to sleep
sometimes. Please check if it is the same for you and try to disable UKSM
first and then BFQ to find out the cause. Enjoy.
