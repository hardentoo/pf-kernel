I'm glad to make an announcement of immediate availability of long-awaited pf-
kernel release for 4.7 kernel. This release incorporates usual set of handy
desktop things, and those are:

  * official BFS v0.472 ( _bare one as -vrq branch issues are still being investigated_ );
  * official BFQ v8;
  * writeback-throttling patchset with BFQ support;
  * graysky's GCC patchset;
  * misc fixes.

The patch is available
[here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.7/patch-4.7-pf1.xz). Binary builds
are already available for Arch Linux and include [Intel Ivy
Bridge](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:post-factum/linux-pf-
ivybridge) and [AMD Jaguar](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:post-
factum/linux-pf-jaguar) variants. Enjoy
