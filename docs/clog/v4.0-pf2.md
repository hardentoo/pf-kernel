As all the patches are officially released for now (UKSM is almost released
too), I'm ready to introduce new pf-kernel version â€” 4.0-pf2. Here is the
[patch](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.0/patch-4.0-pf2.xz).  
  
UKSM has been fixed by its author and -ck1 has been merged. Official BFQ is
similar to my trivial merge.  
  
Shortlog appended.
