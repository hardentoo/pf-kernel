In response to Christos Nouskas request for updated pf-kernel against LTS
Linux branch, I've decided to release new 3.14-pfX, and [here is
3.14-pf5](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.14/patch-3.14-pf5.xz).  
  
Everything has been updated to latest possible versions. There are: stable
branch merged (3.14.29), BFSv454, BFQv7r7 as well as fixed UKSM.  
  
Here is [shortlog](https://gist.github.com/788b5c9193feb0a31ac0), which I've
put onto github due to its size.  
  
Enjoy.
