Another long-awaited pf-kernel release is
[here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.5/patch-4.5-pf4.xz). This time the
release brings you writeback throttling patchset update, latest 4.5 stable
kernel and reverted BFS to official -ck release. The rationale to bring bare
-ck back is that I've faced some VRQ issue, possibly connected with SMT. Now
Alfred and I perform some testing to find out what is going on. Binary
packages for Intel Ivy bridge and AMD Jaguar are available as well. Enjoy.
