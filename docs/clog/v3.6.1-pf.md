Hey, guys.  
  
Here is ready-to-use pf-kernel for Linux 3.6, so grab [the
patch](http://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.6/patch-3.6.1-pf.bz2) and compile it
right now.  
  
As I promised, this release doesn't include BLD as it appeared to be useless
for pf-kernel tasks. That was found out by my interactivity
[kernelat](https://github.com/pfactum/kernelat/) test. So only BFS ( _except
vanilla CFS, of course_ ) is involved as the CPU scheduler.  
  
This release incorporates BFSv424 ported by [Martin here](http://ck-
hack.blogspot.com/2012/08/35-ck1-bfs-424-for-linux-35.html) and fixed by me.  
  
Official BFQ release is also included â€” many thanks to its developers.  
  
TuxOnIce has been merged as well with my small fix to make it compilable. Yes,
there was some issue with unexported symbol.  
  
And I've ported UKSM v0.1.2 by myself, and it works ( _omg!_ ). Hope that UKSM
guys will return from vacation and release official version for 3.6 kernel.  
  
So, all patches are here. Enjoy pf-kernel experience :).  
  
P.S. There was OSDN'2012 conference in Kyiv, Ukraine. If you speak Russian,
you may watch my report about pf-kernel
