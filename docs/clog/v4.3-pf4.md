First pf-kernel release of new year is fairly small. I've merged two fixes regarding TCP stack (I've faced corresponding issues on my home router, so it is very important improvement for me). Also, I've backported fam15h_power changes from 4.5 git tree as I thought they could be useful for someone having AMD CPUs like me. The patch is [here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.3/patch-4.3-pf4.xz). Shortlog appended. P.S. I expect stable 4.3 update to be released soon, so there might be another pf-4.3 branch renewal before releasing v4.4-pf1.
