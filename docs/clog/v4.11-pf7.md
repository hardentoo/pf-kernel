New pf-kernel release is available
[here](https://pf.natalenko.name/sources/4.11/patch-4.11-pf7.xz). It brings
latest stable update, v4.11.8, as well as latest BFQ fixes. So all users are
encouraged to upgrade. Likely, this is the last update for 4.11 kernel. Next
release should be for 4.12 once all necessary patches are ready.
