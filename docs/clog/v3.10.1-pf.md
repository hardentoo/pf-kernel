So, mates, it's time for new show, and I'm proud to introduce first full pf-kernel release for Linux 3.10 branch.  
  
First of all, you need [this wonderful patch](http://pf.natalenko.name/sources/3.10/patch-3.10.1-pf.bz2). Then just apply it to bare 3.10 kernel and have a fun. Binary builds are available as well, but remember, 3.10 branch is the last branch with binary builds from me.  
  
This release contains, as usual, stable updates (3.10.1 for now), -ck patch, BFQ, TuxOnIce, UKSM and EnhanceIO. Everything except last item has been tested by me.  
  
The only thing I'd like to tell you is that never compile this kernel with CONFIG_RCU_USER_QS and CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU options enabled if you plan to use BFS. Otherwise your kernel won't boot. At least, it happened to me.  
  
And do not forget that pf-kernel project welcomes your [donations](http://pf.natalenko.name/donate.php). It's OK to send us some bitcoins to keep it alive.
